My Graph Report
================

Nodes and Edges
---------------

As we know from our earlier lectures nodes and edges are the two basic features when it comes to network graphs. In these communication networks a node is described as a connection point or a communication endpoint. As you can see from my network graph the nodes are considerably large and are coloured blue and yellow. I made the nodes bigger using the sizer tool which allows you to increase or decrease the size of the nodes and you can colour the nodes using the brush tool which colours the selected node and its nearest neighbour. The edges in the graph are the lines that are connecting the different nodes together. Similar to the nodes in my graph, the edges are also blue and yellow and have been increased in scale to make them more visible.  

Brdiges and Bonds
-----------------

Bridges and bonds are another two important features when it comes to these networks of communication. Personally I find it hard to understand the exact purpose of a bridge in communication networks so I used a definition from Techtarget.com which describes it as a product that connects a local area network to another local area network that uses the same protocol. 

Networks
--------

Another important term when it comes to communication networks is the term “network” itself. Networks are essential when it comes to social media etc. because they connect people, whether it’s a weak, strong, intimate or remote connection. Connected people influence each other, share things with each other and create bonds and bridges so without these networks there would be no connections and without connections there would be no social media. As well as people influencing each other through networks and social media there have also been people that have had an influence on social networks and communication networks. These influences were highlighted in earlier lectures and include world renowned people including:
-  Mark Lombardi
-  Stephanie Syjuco
-  David Mccandless
-  Rachel Schragis


Betweenness and Closeness
------------------------


Betweenness and Closeness both fall under the bracket of network centrality which refers to the indicators which identify the most important vertices within a graph which could include, for example, identifying the most important people in a social network. Betweenness centrality has been defined as the number of shortest paths which pass through the given vertex and the Closeness centrality refers to the total distance from a given vertex to all other vertices.


Constructing the Graph
----------------------


The process of the actual graph itself was originally quite easy which was aided with some good instructions but as the process went on it became a bit more technical and more difficult. I started off the process of creating the graph by logging into a social network site of our choice, which was Facebook in my case. I then had to find the netvizz page where it gave me a list of different modules that were available for selection. I chose the personal network module which told me it would extract my friends and the friendship connections between them. After selecting the module I then had to save it to my computer as a gdf file. I then had to download the Gephi programme to my computer. After successfully downloading the programme I then opened up the file from Netvizz in Gephi. When I opened the file I was presented with, what most people would call, a large blob that represented all my friends and the connections between them all on Facebook. I knew there was some work to be done at this stage. In order to turn this “blob” into the final communication network graph that was necessary I had to undergo a few steps. Some of these steps included changing the layout of the graph as well as the colour and size of the nodes and edges. After carrying out all these steps I was left with a different graph but a graph that still looked too packed and crowded. To get rid of this crowded style of the graph I had to change the “degree range” of the graph which lowered the amount of people present in the graph. I lowered mine considerably which left me with very few nodes but made the edges a lot more visible between each node. Trying to turn a clustered, messy graph into a more detailed graph was originally quite difficult but in the end I quite enjoyed this task and might even look into making another one.
